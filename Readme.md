# Console Draw

Console Draw is a simple console version of a drawing program.

## Notes

One of the popular tasks for tech interview is an implementation of application that draws in console. Here it is :)

## Getting Started

1. Install Bundler and dependencies

       $ gem install bundler
       $ bundle install

2. Run specs

       $ rspec

## Using

1. Run application with

       ./bin/console_draw

2. Create a canvas

       C 10 10

3. Draw a rectangle with

       R 2 2 9 9

4. Draw lines with

       L 9 9 2 2
       L 2 9 9 2

5. Fill areas

       B 5 3 i
       B 5 8 i
       B 3 5 o
       B 8 5 o

The result is

    ------------
    |          |
    | xxxxxxxx |
    | xxiiiixx |
    | xoxiixox |
    | xooxxoox |
    | xooxxoox |
    | xoxiixox |
    | xxiiiixx |
    | xxxxxxxx |
    |          |
    ------------

6. Clean the canvas with

       C

7. Draw a circle with with

       CIRCLE 5 5 3

8. Quit the application with

       Q


## Details

### Supported figures

Points are generated by figures' algorithms located in the folder `lib/figures`. Every figure must inherits from `ConsoleDraw::Figures::Base` and implements common method `#calculate_coordinates` that returns an array of coordinates.

### Line

Line figure generates points by [algorithm of Bresenham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm) for raster image. Input parameters for a line are coordinates of the first and the last points.

### Rectangle

Rectangle figure uses Line figures as edges to generate points. Input parameters for a rectangle are coordinates of an upper left and a lower right corners.

### Circle

Circle figure generates points by [algorithm of Bresenham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm) for raster image. Input parameters for a circle are coordinates of the center and radius.

### Canvas

Canvas is a storage of points generated by figures. A figure might be drawn on a canvas object with a method `#draw`.

### Renders

Points map of canvas is rendered to string by class `ConsoleDraw::Render::StringRenderer` using "Raster scan" technique.

## CLI

Instantiates a command executor and sends user's input to the command executor. Command executor has a Context object, that provides an interface to draw on canvas and render canvas as String.

Corner cases are respected - available commands are whitelisted, implemented a confirmation for too big parameters (for example, attempt to create a canvas 200 * 200 requires a confirmation). If user's input is invalid, application should return an error message and fail a command.
